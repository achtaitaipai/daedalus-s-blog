As I continue to settle into my new home in Crete, I have been closely following the events of the kingdom. One recent development that has caught my attention is King Minos's decision not to sacrifice the bull that was brought to him as an offering.

While I understand the king's reluctance to carry out this tradition, I cannot help but wonder about the consequences of this decision. In the past, the sacrifice of the bull was believed to appease the gods and ensure the prosperity of the kingdom. Without this sacrifice, I fear that there may be unforeseen consequences.

I have shared my concerns with the king, but he remains firm in his decision. I can only hope that my worries are unfounded and that the kingdom will continue to thrive. Time will tell what the future holds.
