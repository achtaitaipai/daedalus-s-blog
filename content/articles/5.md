title: "A New Home in Crete"
---

After my exile from Athens, I have found myself in a new land: the island of Crete. It is a beautiful and vibrant place, with a rich history and culture.

I have been welcomed here by King Minos, who has offered me the opportunity to work as an engineer and inventor for his kingdom. It is a generous offer, and I am grateful for the chance to continue using my skills and talents to benefit others.

I am looking forward to exploring this new land and getting to know the people and customs of Crete. It will be a challenge to adjust to a new home and start anew, but I am determined to make the most of this opportunity and make a positive contribution to my new community.

Here's to a new beginning in Crete!
