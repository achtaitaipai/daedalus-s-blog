It seems that the scandal and turmoil that I feared would result from Queen Pasiphae's obsession with the bull has come to pass.

Today, I was approached by the queen with a strange request: she asked me to create a wooden cow for her to use in order to consummate her passion for the bull. I was shocked and dismayed by this request, and I strongly advised against it.

However, the queen is determined to carry out her plan, and has offered me a large sum of gold to complete the task. I am torn between my loyalty to the queen and my desire to do what is right.

I can only hope that this situation will resolve itself peacefully and that the kingdom will not be further destabilized by the queen's actions.
