It is with great sadness that I write this entry. Today, we learned of the tragic death of Androgeus, the son of King Minos and Queen Pasiphae.

According to the reports, Androgeus was killed while competing in the games at Athens. It is a terrible loss, and the kingdom is mourning the passing of such a promising young man.

I can only imagine the heartbreak and grief that King Minos and Queen Pasiphae must be feeling at this time. My thoughts and condolences go out to them and the entire royal family.

May Androgeus rest in peace and may his memory be a blessing.
