It is with a heavy heart that I write this entry. It seems that my fears about the consequences of King Minos's decision not to sacrifice the bull have come to pass.

Instead of being offered as a sacrifice, the bull has been kept as a prize possession of the kingdom. However, this has had unintended consequences. Queen Pasiphae, who was present at the bull's arrival, has become inexplicably and obsessively attracted to the animal.

I fear that this passion will lead to great scandal and upheaval within the royal household, and I cannot help but feel that this tragedy could have been avoided if the bull had been sacrificed as tradition dictated. It is a harsh reminder of the dangers of hubris and the importance of respecting tradition.

I can only hope that the situation will be resolved peacefully and that the kingdom will be able to avoid further turmoil. I will continue to do what I can to help and support the people of Crete during these trying times.
