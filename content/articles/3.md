It is with a heavy heart that I write this entry. As many of you know, my dear nephew Talos has been a constant presence in my life and work for many years. He was a bright and promising young engineer, with a natural aptitude and curiosity for the field.

Talos was always eager to learn and take on new challenges, and he had already made a number of impressive inventions in his short career. His creativity and ingenuity were a constant source of inspiration to me, and I was proud to be able to mentor and guide him in his studies.

However, despite our close relationship, I allowed my own feelings of insecurity and jealousy to cloud my judgment. When Talos presented a new invention that he had been working on, I felt threatened by his potential success and let my emotions get the better of me. In a moment of weakness, I took his life.

I am filled with remorse and grief over this terrible act, and I understand that I must face the consequences of my actions. I have been exiled from Athens and must leave behind everything and everyone that I have known and loved.

I cannot begin to express the depth of my regret and sorrow. Talos was more than just a nephew to me - he was a dear friend and a source of inspiration. His loss is a tragedy that I will carry with me for the rest of my days.
