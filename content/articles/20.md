title: "The End of Minos"

I have been aware of Cocalos' plan for a few days now. He invited Minos to his palace and offered him the chance to share a bath with his three daughters in a tub that I made. I knew that this tub was rigged and that Minos would meet his end in it.

I am relieved that Cocalos has finally chosen to protect me and betray Minos. However, I am also sad that Cocalos' daughters had to witness this tragic event. Minos is now dead, and I don't know what the future holds for me. I will simply have to face whatever comes my way.
