It is the eve of the day we have planned to escape from the labyrinth. After months of preparation and hard work, we are finally ready to put our plan into action.

The plan is simple, yet risky. We will use the wings that I have crafted from feathers and wax to fly out of the labyrinth and escape from the island of Crete. It is a risky endeavor, as I have never tested these wings before and we have no idea how well they will perform.

Despite my confidence in my abilities, I cannot help but feel a sense of trepidation as the time of our escape draws near. What if something goes wrong? What if the wings do not work as planned? These are the thoughts that have been running through my mind as I count down the hours until we put our plan into action.
