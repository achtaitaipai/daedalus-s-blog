title: "The Siege of Athens"
---

The kingdom of Crete is in a state of unrest and turmoil. In the wake of the death of Androgeus, King Minos has declared war on Athens and laid siege to the city.

The king's anger towards Athens is understandable, as the city was responsible for the death of his son. However, the consequences of this conflict have been disastrous for both sides. Many lives have been lost, and the economies of both cities have been greatly impacted.

To make matters worse, King Minos has demanded a tribute from Athens as a condition of ending the siege. The tribute consists of the annual sending of seven young men and seven young women to serve as sacrifice to the Minotaur. The Athenians are understandably reluctant to comply with this demand, and the stalemate between the two cities continues.

I can only hope that a peaceful resolution can be reached and that this tragic conflict will come to an end.
