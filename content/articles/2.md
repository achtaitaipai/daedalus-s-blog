title: "The Progress of My Nephew, Talos"
---

I am proud to report that my nephew, Talos, is making great progress in his studies and training as an engineer. At just 20 years old, he has already demonstrated a natural aptitude and curiosity for the field, and I have no doubt that he will go on to achieve great things.

Talos has been working on a number of exciting projects lately, and he is eager to show me the results of his hard work. He has recently completed the design for a revolutionary new saw and a pair of compasses, and he is eager to present them to me and discuss the possibilities for their use.

I am confident that with hard work and dedication, Talos will become a valuable asset to the engineering community in Athens. I am excited to see where his talents and passions will take him in the future, and I am looking forward to discussing his ideas with him.
