title: "The Fall of the Minotaur"
---

The news of Theseus's success in defeating the Minotaur has spread like wildfire throughout the kingdom of Crete. The people are rejoicing at the end of this long and bloody conflict, and Athens has been spared the annual tribute of young men and women.

However, not everyone is pleased by these developments. King Minos is filled with rage and despair at the loss of his beloved creature, and he has blamed me for the failure of the labyrinth to contain it. As punishment, I have been imprisoned in the labyrinth along with my son, Icarus.

We are confined to the labyrinth, unable to leave and with no hope of escape. It is a harsh sentence, but I cannot deny that I bear some responsibility for the events that have transpired.

I can only hope that, in time, King Minos will find it in his heart to forgive me and that I will be allowed to return to my home and my loved ones. Until then, I will do my best to keep Icarus safe and to use my skills and talents to the best of my ability in this difficult situation.
