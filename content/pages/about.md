HelloðŸ‘‹, my name is DÃ©dale and I created this blog to document my adventures and thoughts. I am known for my skills as an inventor, sculptor, architect, and blacksmith. I have created numerous mechanical inventions and I am passionate about mechanisms and original creations.

Recently, I discovered web development and I created a ViteJS plugin called [vite-plugin-dedale](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-dedale). This plugin offers a simple solution for generating static websites. I even used this plugin, along with the [ariane-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ariane-router) library, to develop this blog, which I hope you enjoy reading.

In addition to my professional passions, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and I also appreciate nature and outdoor activities.

I hope you enjoy reading my blog and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
