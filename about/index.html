    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>HelloðŸ‘‹, my name is DÃ©dale and I created this blog to document my adventures and thoughts. I am known for my skills as an inventor, sculptor, architect, and blacksmith. I have created numerous mechanical inventions and I am passionate about mechanisms and original creations.</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered web development and I created a ViteJS plugin called &quot;vite-plugin-dedale&quot;. This plugin offers a simple solution for generating static websites. I even used this plugin to develop this blog, which I hope you enjoy reading.</p>
<p>In addition to my professional passions, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and I also appreciate nature and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy reading my blog and please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or comments.</p>
