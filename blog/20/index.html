    <p>I have been aware of Cocalos&#39; plan for a few days now. He invited Minos to his palace and offered him the chance to share a bath with his three daughters in a tub that I made. I knew that this tub was rigged and that Minos would meet his end in it.</p>
<p>I am relieved that Cocalos has finally chosen to protect me and betray Minos. However, I am also sad that Cocalos&#39; daughters had to witness this tragic event. Minos is now dead, and I don&#39;t know what the future holds for me. I will simply have to face whatever comes my way.</p>
