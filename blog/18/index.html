    <p>I have found refuge in Sicily, at the court of King Cocalos. It is a new and unfamiliar place, but I am grateful for the opportunity to start a new life and to put the tragedies of the past behind me.</p>
<p>I have dedicated myself to my work and have used my skills and talents to the best of my ability. I have also tried to make amends for my past mistakes and to find ways to honor the memory of my son, Icarus.</p>
<p>One way I have found to do this is by presenting my wings as a gift to Apollo, the god of the sun. I hope that by offering this tribute, I can appease the anger of the gods and seek forgiveness for my affront.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the future holds, but I am determined to make the most of my circumstances and to use my skills and talents to the best of my ability. I will continue to document my experiences in this blog and to honor the memory of my beloved son, Icarus.</p>
