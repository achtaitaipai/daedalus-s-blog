    <p>It has been a few months since our escape from the labyrinth, and I am still trying to come to terms with what happened.</p>
<p>Everything was going according to plan. We donned the wings that I had crafted and flew out of the labyrinth, leaving the island of Crete behind us. The flight was exhilarating and filled with a sense of freedom and hope.</p>
<p>However, our joy was short-lived. As we flew further from the island, Icarus became overexcited and flew too close to the sun. The wax that held the feathers of his wings together melted, and he plummeted into the sea.</p>
<p>I tried to save him, but it was too late. I watched in horror as my beloved son plunged into the water and drowned. It was a tragic and devastating loss, and I will carry the guilt and grief with me for the rest of my days.</p>
<p>I have since landed on an island and have started a new life here. It is a lonely existence without Icarus, but I try to find solace in my work and in the memories of the time we spent together. I will always regret the accident that took his life, but I hope that by documenting our experiences in this blog, I can keep his memory alive and honor his life.</p>
