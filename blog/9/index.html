    <p>It is with a heavy heart that I write this entry. The consequences of Queen Pasiphae&#39;s actions have come to fruition, and the kingdom of Crete will never be the same.</p>
<p>The wooden cow that I was commissioned to create has been used by the queen to consummate her passion for the bull, and as a result, a creature has been born: the Minotaur.</p>
<p>The Minotaur is a monstrous being, with the body of a man and the head of a bull. It is a creature of myth and legend, and its existence has sent shockwaves throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to express the depth of my regret and sorrow for my role in this tragic turn of events. I can only hope that the Minotaur will be treated with mercy and that the kingdom will find a way to move forward from this tragedy.</p>
