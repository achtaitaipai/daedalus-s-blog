    <p>As I sit down to write this entry, I am filled with a sense of sadness and nostalgia. After spending many years in Athens, I have been forced to leave the city due to the tragic events that occurred.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I made a terrible mistake that resulted in the loss of my dear nephew Talos. I cannot begin to express the depth of my regret and sorrow for this tragic act, and I understand that I must face the consequences of my actions.</p>
<p>As a result of my actions, I have been banished from Athens and must leave behind everything and everyone that I have known and loved. It will not be easy to say goodbye to the city that has been my home for so long and to the many friends and colleagues that I have made here.</p>
<p>However, I believe that it is important to keep moving forward and to embrace change, no matter how difficult it may be. I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that Athens has given me, and I will always cherish the memories that I have made here.</p>
<p>Farewell, Athens, and may our paths cross again someday.</p>
